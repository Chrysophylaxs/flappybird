# Flappy Bird, implemented with pygame
`flappy_user.py`: Simple flappy bird game without any sprites, jump using the spacebar!
`flappy_neat.py`: Flappy bird extended with the NEAT algorithm. Pressing space will disable drawing of all the entities, which will drastically speed up the training process.
`config.txt`: A configuration file filled with parameters used by NEAT.
