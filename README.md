# Flappy Bird, implemented with pygame
- `flappy_user.py`: Simple flappy bird game without any sprites, jump using the spacebar!
- `flappy_neat.py`: Flappy bird extended with the NEAT algorithm. Pressing space will disable drawing of all the entities, which will drastically speed up the training process.
- `config.txt`: A configuration file filled with parameters used by NEAT.

## Running the code
Install the [`pygame`](https://pygame.org) library using pip. The code is run by `python flappy_user.py` in your terminal of choice. In order to run the AI version, install [`neat-python`](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
